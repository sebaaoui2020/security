These come in all shapes and sizes, including lockers, bins, laundry baskets, pushchairs, food stalls, photo booths and even Freddy himself. "

They're often fast and the size of areas means they can disappear and reappear without warning. However, you have one tool the animatronics don't: access to the various cameras dotted around each area. "

Every single one will be able to finish Gregory off by catching him just once and, bar a few specific scenarios, there are no checkpoints you can easily jump to when that happens. The only way to make sure you're not replaying long stretches of the game after being caught is to make save points a regular part of your routine. "

Unfortunately, trying to outrun a pursuer usually isn't a wise idea. While you'll initially be able to put distance between yourself and an animatronic, Gregory's stamina meter will eventually run out and he'll run at a pace perfect for an animatronic looking to snag itself an easy meal.
